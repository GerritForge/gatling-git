      "message": "The only issue I have with this approach is that it wouldn\u0027t cover a use case I was keen to use the load test for. Maybe it is a misuse of the tool, but it would be very handy for me.\n\nMy use case if the following: I want to run the same load test *at the same time* on 2 instances with different Gerrit versions, so I can compare the results on the same graph. The instances, of course, will have different urls. How can I inject them?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it would be a good solution of just using one client to test multiple instances. The network bandwidth etc., when just using one client/computer might be a significant bottle neck, when testing high loads.\nI would rather suggest to run two clients in parallel on separate machines in that case, to make sure that this bottle neck is not that relevant and that the two separate runs do not interfere. I was anyway planning to dockerize these tests ands create a Kubernetes deployment for exactly such scenarios and then each client would get its own URL configured.",
