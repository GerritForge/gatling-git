### Setup

If you are running SSH commands the private keys of the users used for testing need to go in `/tmp/ssh-keys`.
The keys need to be generated this way (JSch won't validate them [otherwise](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53134212/invalid-privatekey-when-using-jsch):

```bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -C "test@mail.com" -f /tmp/ssh-keys/id_rsa
```

NOTE: Don't forget to add the public keys for the testing user(s) to your git server

### Run

All tests:
```
sbt "gatling:test"
```

Single test:
```
sbt "gatling:testOnly com.github.barbasa.gatling.git.ReplayRecordsScenario"
```

Report:
```
sbt "gatling:lastReport"
```
